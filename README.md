# Policy Gradient Implementation - Reinforce
This code includes a simple implementation of Reinforce using TensorFlow 2. Both continuous and discrete action space implementations are includes.  The code is  inspired by the following post: [Policy Gradient REINFORCE Algorithm with Baseline](https://towardsdatascience.com/policy-gradient-reinforce-algorithm-with-baseline-e95ace11c1c4)
